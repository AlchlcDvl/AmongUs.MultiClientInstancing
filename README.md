# AmongUs.MultiClientInstancing

I think the best way to describe this is as a method of host testing what your "mod" could look like with multiple clients.
It is in no way a replacement for testing your mod and has a complete disregard for rpc calls.
It can also be buggy with different mods differently depending on how they interact with amongus - so chances are its not going to be perfect.
Think of this as more like a ease-of-access utility then a standlone testing environment.

Whilst in lobby press f5 to add players,
and in game press f9 to move up or f10 to move down through the id list.

i've left it openended for any future features but i dont think i can see myself regularly maintaning this beyond bug fixes,
but your welcome to pr and contribute
